      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <h2>Did it live up to expectations?</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, yes it did live up to my expectations. I didn't totally know
        what to expect with React and node.js, but I was very impressed by the
        power and intuitiveness of it. I like the potential it has to make even
        more complicated websites without having to go through another large
        learning curve.
      </p>
      <h2>Installation/Configuration Difficulty</h2>
      <p>
        Installation was very easy and straightforward. Integrating every part
        together, was a complete nightmare. Getting seperate hosting set up for
        the front-end, server, and database, then on top of that connecting them
        all together, took more late nights than I ever would have expected. Now
        that I have done it once though, it will be easy in the future.
      </p>
      <h2>Page Creation Difficulty</h2>
      <p>
        Creating the page itself had a bit of a learning curve, but nothing more
        than I expected for a web framework like this. It took a long time to
        learn, but the concepts were not too hard to understand; there was just
        a lot more going on than basic HTML/CSS/PHP.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning Curve Comparison</h2>
      <p>
        The learning curve for the configuration, hosting, and integration was
        extremely steep compared to other topics covered in CPS530. I think that
        the learning curve for the actual website building was definitly larger
        compared to topics covered in class, but smaller relative to the power
        React.js and Node.js have.
      </p>
      <h2>In Retrospect</h2>
      <p>
        During the process I seriously considered giving up and choosing another
        framework for the project. But when I look back on it, I don't think I
        would have done anything differently; I am happy with how this project
        turned out.
      </p>
      <h2>Do I regret my choices?</h2>
      <p>
        I do not regret my choices. It was hard getting through this project,
        but becoming comfortable with making full-stack applications with
        popular frameworks like these has been a goal for me for a while. I am
        very glad that I was forced to learn all this so that I can take my
        personal projects to the next level.
